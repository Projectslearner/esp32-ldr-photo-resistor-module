# ESP32 LDR Photo Resistor Module Project

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates how to use an LDR (Light Dependent Resistor) with an ESP32 microcontroller to detect light levels. The LDR's resistance changes based on the amount of light it is exposed to, and this change can be measured using the ESP32's analog-to-digital converter (ADC).

## Components Needed
- ESP32 Microcontroller
- LDR (Light Dependent Resistor)
- Resistor (10kŒ© recommended)
- Jumper Wires
- Breadboard

## Block Diagram
(Include a block diagram illustrating the connection between the ESP32, LDR, and resistor)

## Circuit Setup
1. **Connecting the LDR to ESP32:**
   - Connect one end of the LDR to the 3.3V power supply.
   - Connect the other end of the LDR to both an analog input pin (GPIO 34) on the ESP32 and to one end of the 10kŒ© resistor.
   - Connect the other end of the 10kŒ© resistor to the ground (GND).

## Instructions
1. **Setup:**
   - Define the GPIO pin connected to the LDR.
   - Set a threshold value to determine when light is detected. This value might need adjustment based on your specific setup and lighting conditions.

2. **Operation:**
   - Initialize serial communication at a baud rate of 115200 for debugging purposes.
   - Read the analog value from the LDR using `analogRead()`.
   - Print the LDR value to the Serial Monitor.
   - Compare the LDR value to the threshold to determine if light is present or not.
   - Print the result to the Serial Monitor.
   - Add a delay before the next reading.

3. **Considerations:**
   - **Sensor Calibration:** Adjust the threshold value based on your environment's lighting conditions for accurate light detection.
   - **Ambient Light:** Ensure that ambient light conditions are considered when setting up the LDR for consistent readings.
   - **Sensor Placement:** Place the LDR in a location where it can accurately measure the desired light levels.

## Applications
- **Light Detection:** Use the LDR to detect the presence or absence of light in various applications.
- **Ambient Light Monitoring:** Monitor and log ambient light levels in different environments.
- **Automatic Lighting Systems:** Integrate the LDR into systems to automate lighting based on detected light levels.

## Notes
- **Serial Output:** Utilize the Serial Monitor to observe real-time LDR values and adjust the threshold accordingly.
- **Power Supply:** Ensure the ESP32 and LDR are properly powered for stable operation.
